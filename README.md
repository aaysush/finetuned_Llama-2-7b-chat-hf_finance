## Project Documentation: Fine-Tuning LLaMA-2-7B for Finance Q&A

### Overview

This project involves fine-tuning the LLaMA-2-7B base model to create a finance-focused conversational AI capable of answering questions and providing insights on stocks and financial topics. The fine-tuning process leveraged multiple data sources, processed into a format suitable for the LLaMA model, and applied QLoRA for parameter-efficient training.

---

### Data Collection

The training data was compiled from several sources:

1. **Web Scraping**:

   * Multiple finance-related websites were scraped to extract question-and-answer pairs.
   * Scripts were written to process and clean the scraped data into a structured format suitable for LLaMA.

2. **Book Data**:

   * A finance book in PDF format was used as a source of Q&A.
   * The content was extracted and converted into a structured Q&A format using Python scripts.

3. **Kaggle Datasets**:

   * Relevant Kaggle datasets containing finance Q&A were used.
   * Scripts were applied to clean and standardize the data to match the fine-tuning format.

4. **Data Consolidation**:

   * All sources were combined into a final dataset.
   * The final dataset was formatted in JSONL format, ensuring each entry had a clear `question` and `answer` for training.

### Fine-Tuning

* **Base Model:** `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`
* **Method:** QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
* **Library:** [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) and Hugging Face Transformers
* **Training Configuration:**

  * Low-rank dimension `r = 16`
  * Scaling factor `alpha = 32`
  * Target modules: `q_proj` and `v_proj`
  * 4-bit quantization (`bnb_config`) for VRAM efficiency

This approach allowed fine-tuning the large LLaMA model on limited hardware while preserving performance and reducing memory requirements.

---

### Additional Features

* **Live Stock Data Integration:**

  * The chatbot also integrates Yahoo Finance API to provide real-time stock information.
  * When users ask about a stock (e.g., ‚ÄúTell me about AAPL‚Äù), the system fetches live data and generates a response using the fine-tuned model.

* **Data Pipeline:**

  * All Q&A sources were preprocessed into a clean format.
  * Scripts ensured consistent formatting, removed unnecessary characters, and structured data for causal language modeling.

---

### Outcome

* A finance-focused conversational model capable of:

  * Answering general finance questions
  * Providing real-time stock insights
  * Handling conversational queries intelligently using the fine-tuned LLaMA model

* **Model Efficiency:**

  * Fine-tuning using QLoRA allowed running the model on 4-bit quantization, significantly reducing VRAM usage.

If you want, I can also **write a compact ‚ÄúModel Card ready‚Äù version** for Hugging Face that summarizes all this neatly with proper fields filled. It‚Äôll look professional on your Hub page. Do you want me to do that?
